# showandtell - guide for beginners! 
This is the show and tell project for a course

I will try to collect links and concepts that I find will be helpful to students of this course who might need more quick starting points on some technical concepts & interesting stuff I find throughout the course. 


1. starting with Github & its basic concepts 
2. basic programming youtube clips that I find useful
3. sharing about the project and some background knowledge that's useful

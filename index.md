# Guide for absolute beginngers ! 

While professors and instructors are kind to explain what Github does, for those of us who have asbolutely no background in computer coding, here are some resources that might get you started (at least I find them useful) and in completing your assignments !  

## Desktop Github 
YES! this option is available

[Desktop Github](https://desktop.github.com) - this gets Github installed on your local machine and there are tutorials to guide you through 

### the very basic concept:

- [Push](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push)(in my own words meaning making changes to the code and share it with others - push out for the world to see/review)
- [Pull](https://github.com/git-guides/git-pull)(in my own words meaning reviewing changes that have been proposed to the original codes - hence pulling in changes and incorporate them if you like them!) 
- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) (in my own words meaning making a copy at your own machine and thus any changes you make will not impact the upstream codes) 

## Something about Twitter

I tried to make a workflow for twitter account and it turns out that you would need a developer account for it - if this is what you want to do for your show and tell, do remember to apply for it as it takes time to get approval from Twitter.  

### Twitter API & Twitter Project examples:

- [Twitter API Users Case for Research](https://developer.twitter.com/en/use-cases/do-research)
- [Twitter together Project in Githubhttps](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/twitter-together)

## Useful site on climate change and I'm very fond of:
1. [Environmental Graphiti®](https://www.environmentalgraphiti.org/) Let Arts do the talk science
2. [Future Scenarios](https://www.vox.com/22620706/climate-change-ipcc-report-2021-ssp-scenario-future-warming) Future climate scenarios explained


## Resources that will need efforts to make it more widely available and easy to be used:



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Kyovelve/showandtell/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


 




Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)



```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Kyovelve/showandtell/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

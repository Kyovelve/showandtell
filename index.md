# Guide for absolute beginngers ! 

While professors and instructors are kind to explain what Github does, for those of us who have asbolutely no background in computer coding, here are some resources that might get you started (at least I find them useful) and in completing your assignments !  

## Desktop Github 
YES! this option is available

[Desktop Github](https://desktop.github.com) - this gets Github installed on your local machine and there are tutorials to guide you through 

### the very basic concept:

- [Push](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push)(in my own words meaning making changes to the code and share it with others - push out for the world to see/review)
- [Pull](https://github.com/git-guides/git-pull)(in my own words meaning reviewing changes that have been proposed to the original codes - hence pulling in changes and incorporate them if you like them!) 
- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) (in my own words meaning making a copy at your own machine and thus any changes you make will not impact the upstream codes) 

## Something about Twitter

I tried to make a workflow for twitter account and it turns out that you would need a developer account for it - if this is what you want to do for your show and tell, do remember to apply for it as it takes time to get approval from Twitter.  

### Twitter API & Twitter Project examples:

- [Twitter together Project in Github](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/twitter-together)

## EcoFinance (project app)
As part of the course, the group has conceptualised an app called EcoFinance that aims to raise awareness of the relationship bewteen finance and its impact on the larger society, more notably on the environment.

## Useful site on climate change and the Paris agreement we all heard so much about:
1. [Environmental Graphiti®](https://www.environmentalgraphiti.org/) Let Arts do the talk science
2. [Future Scenarios](https://www.vox.com/22620706/climate-change-ipcc-report-2021-ssp-scenario-future-warming) Future climate scenarios explained
3. [Climate Action Trakcer](https://climateactiontracker.org) Do you know the progress of your country for climate actions? 


## Resources that will need efforts to make it more widely available and easy to be used:
1. [Science-based target](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/?tab=develop#resource) Resources in helping companies to set their own carbon reduction target
2. [Financed Carbon Emission](https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/) How to account for the carbon emission in Banks/insurance companies' loans & assets?
